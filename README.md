Goal is to predict the direction of travel (in camera frame) from provided dashcam video.

- This repo has 10 videos. Every video is 1min long and 20 fps.
- 5 videos are labeled with a 2D array describing the direction of travel at every frame of the video
  with a pitch and yaw angle in radians.
- 5 videos are unlabeled. It is your task to generate the labels for them.
- The example labels are generated using a Neural Network, and the labels were confirmed with a SLAM algorithm.
- Focal length is 910 pixels.

Context
------
The devices that run [openpilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/) are not mounted perfectly. The camera
is not exactly aligned to the vehicle. There is some pitch and yaw angle between the camera of the device and
the vehicle, which can vary between installations. Estimating these angles is essential for accurate control
of the vehicle. The best way to start estimating these values is to predict the direction of motion in camera
frame. More info  can be found in [this readme](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/tree/master/common/transformations).
